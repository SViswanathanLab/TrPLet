# CancerDepPrediction

Cancer dependency prediction from RNA (CaDeRNA)
If used, please cite: "A landscape and prediction of dependencies in TFE3 fusion-driven cancers" (Li* & Sadagopan* et al.)

We provide the workflow and scripts to take 


workflow differs slightly depending on input data. There are a few things to consider prior to implementing the general procedure. Your goal is to get your RNA-seq data batch corrected with either TCGA or CCLE 

- Batch Correction Considerations

- Mutation Data (optional)

- Cell Line RNA-Seq (no batch correction)

- Cell Line RNA-Seq (with batch correction)
